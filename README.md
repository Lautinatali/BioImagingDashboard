# BioImaging Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard for visualizing live cell imaging data (e.g. IncucyteÂ® data) built using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/). It allows users to upload data, visualize it in various formats (line plots, multi-plots, heatmaps), and export the visualizations in different formats.

## Expected inputs
As of now, the program intakes a .xslx file with 3-5 tabs: "treatments", "celltypes" and at least one of "phase", "green" and "red". Treatments and celltypes should contain the platemap information regarding treatments applied and cell types used in the experiment, while the rest of the tabs should include an "Elapsed" column with time data and several other columns with microscopy data (fluorescence, confluence, etc) with the column header being the well identifier (e.g. A1, B3, etc). Included in the project files there is an example file. 

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Upload Excel files to visualize data.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**:
  - Individual plots for selected data types (e.g., Phase, Green, Red, Green/Red Ratio).
  - Multi-plot view to compare multiple data types side by side.
  - Heatmaps to visualize data trends over time and treatments.
- **Customizable Exports**:
  - Export graphs in SVG or PNG format.
  - Specify custom filenames for exported graphs.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with [Dash Bootstrap Components](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/) for a clean and responsive UI.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lautinatali/BioImagingDashboard.git
   cd plotly-dashboard
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   python src/dashboard.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` to view the dashboard.

## Usage

1. **Upload Data**:
   - Drag and drop an Excel file or select one using the upload component.
   - Ensure the file contains the required sheets (minimum required is celltypes, treatments and one of phase/green/red).

2. **Select Data Type**:
   - Choose the data type to visualize individually (e.g., Phase, Green, Red, Green/Red Ratio).

3. **Customize Visualizations**:
   - Filter by treatments and cell types.
   - Switch between tabs for individual plots, multi-plots, diagnostics, and heatmaps.

4. **Export Graphs**:
   - Select the export format (SVG or PNG).
   - Specify a custom filename for the exported graph.

## Tabs Overview

- **Individual**: Displays a single plot for the selected data type.
- **Multi Plot**: Displays multiple plots side by side for comparison.
- **Heatmaps**: Displays data as heatmaps with treatments on the X-axis, time on the Y-axis, and values represented by color intensity.
- **Diagnostics**: Provides diagnostic information about the uploaded data.
